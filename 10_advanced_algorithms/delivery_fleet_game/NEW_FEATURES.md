# 🎮 NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

## ✨ Feature Summary

All requested features have been successfully implemented and integrated!

---

## 1. 🔄 Clear Button

**Location:** Controls panel, next to Plan button

**Functionality:**
- Clears planned routes from the map
- Resets UI state
- Re-enables planning
- Allows users to try different algorithms without executing

**Usage:**
1. Plan routes with any algorithm
2. If not satisfied, click "Clear"
3. Choose different algorithm and plan again

---

## 2. 📈 Marketing & Package Rate System

**Location:** New "Marketing" button in controls panel

**Features:**
- **5 Marketing Levels** with progressive package volume
- **Dynamic Package Generation** based on marketing level
- **Strategic Gameplay** - invest in marketing to grow business

### Marketing Levels & Costs

| Level | Daily Volume | Upgrade Cost | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | 25m³ | Starting | Base level |
| 2 | 32.5m³ (+30%) | $20,000 | Early growth |
| 3 | 42.5m³ (+70%) | $35,000 | Expansion phase |
| 4 | 55m³ (+120%) | $55,000 | Major operations |
| 5 | 70m³ (+180%) | $80,000 | Maximum capacity |

### How It Works

1. **Click "Marketing"** button
   - Shows current marketing level
   - Displays daily package volume
   - Shows upgrade cost

2. **Strategic Decision**
   - Higher marketing = More packages
   - Need bigger fleet to handle volume
   - Balance investment vs capacity

3. **Dynamic Generation**
   - Days 1-5: Use predefined JSON files (tutorial)
   - Day 6+: Generate packages based on marketing level
   - Realistic package distribution (size, payment, destinations)

---

## 3. 💰 Cost/Reward Display (Planning Mode)

**Location:** Stats panel (appears when routes are planned)

**Displays:**
- **Cost:** Total operational cost (red)
- **Revenue:** Total package payments (green)
- **Profit:** Net profit (green if positive, red if negative)

**Usage:**
1. Click "Plan Routes"
2. See financial breakdown immediately
3. Decide whether to execute or clear and replan
4. Compare different algorithms

**Example:**
```
Cost:     $1,250  (red)
Revenue:  $2,800  (green)
Profit:   $1,550  (green)
```

---

## 4. 📝 Improved Text Readability

**Changes:**
- **Body text:** 14px → 16px (+14%)
- **Small text:** 12px → 14px (+17%)
- **Affects:** Tooltips, legend, all UI text

**Impact:**
- Much easier to read hover information
- Legend more visible and professional
- Better for classroom projection
- Improved accessibility

---

## 5. 🎨 Fixed Button Layout

**Problem Solved:**
- Save and Stats buttons were being pushed off screen
- All 9 buttons now fit perfectly

**Solution:**
- Reduced button height: 35px → 32px
- Optimized spacing: 36px between buttons
- Last button at y=750 (well within 800px window)

**Current Layout:**
```
📦 Start Day     (full width)
🚚 Buy Vehicle   (full width)
🧠 Plan | 🔄 Clear  (split)
▶️ Execute | ⏭️ Next  (split)
📈 Marketing     (full width)
💾 Save | 📊 Stats  (split)
```

## 📦 Package Generation System

**New File:** `src/utils/package_generator.py`

**Features:**
- Realistic package distribution
  - 40% small packages (1.0-2.5m³)
  - 40% medium packages (2.5-4.0m³)
  - 20% large packages (4.0-6.0m³)
- Payment based on volume + distance
- 15% high-priority packages (1.5x payment)
- Clustered destinations for realistic routing
- Descriptive package types (Electronics, Furniture, etc.)

**Integration:**
- Modified `src/core/engine.py`
  - Added package generator initialization
  - Updated `load_day_packages()` method
  - Falls back to JSON for days 1-5
  - Uses dynamic generation for day 6+

---

## 🎯 Gameplay Flow

### Early Game (Days 1-5)
1. Start with 2 vehicles, 25m³ capacity
2. Predefined packages (balanced tutorials)
3. Learn routing algorithms
4. Build up balance

### Mid Game (Days 6-15)
1. Buy more vehicles (expand capacity)
2. Upgrade marketing (increase package volume)
3. Dynamically generated packages
4. Strategic decisions: invest or save?

### Late Game (Days 16-30)
1. Large fleet operations
2. Max marketing level
3. 70m³ daily packages
4. Optimize for maximum profit

## 🎮 User Experience Improvements

### Planning Workflow
```
1. Start Day → Packages appear
2. Check capacity (colored indicator)
3. Plan Routes → See cost/reward instantly
4. Not happy? → Clear and try different algorithm
5. Satisfied? → Execute and collect profit
```

### Marketing Strategy
```
1. Check balance (can afford upgrade?)
2. Open Marketing modal
3. See volume increase
4. Upgrade if beneficial
5. Buy vehicles to match capacity
6. Profit from increased volume
```

### Visual Feedback

- ✅ Larger, readable text
- ✅ Distinct route colors
- ✅ Professional layout
