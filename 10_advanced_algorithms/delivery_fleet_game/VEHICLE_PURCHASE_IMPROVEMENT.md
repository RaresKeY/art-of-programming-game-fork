## 🔧 Technical Details

### Modal Size
- **Before:** 600×500 (too small)
- **After:** 650×650 (fits all specs comfortably)

### Code Changes

**main_pygame.py - `on_buy_vehicle()` method:**

```python
# Show balance at top
content = [
    ("🚚 VEHICLE PURCHASE", Colors.TEXT_ACCENT),
    ("", Colors.TEXT_PRIMARY),
    (f"Your Balance: ${self.engine.game_state.balance:,.0f}", Colors.PROFIT_POSITIVE),
    ("", Colors.TEXT_PRIMARY),
]

# For each vehicle, show detailed specs
for vtype_name, vtype in self.engine.vehicle_types.items():
    can_afford = vtype.purchase_price <= self.engine.game_state.balance

    content.append((f"━━━ {vtype.name.upper()} ━━━", name_color))
    content.append((f"   Capacity: {vtype.capacity_m3:.0f} m³", spec_color))
    content.append((f"   Purchase Price: ${vtype.purchase_price:,}", spec_color))
    content.append((f"   Operating Cost: ${vtype.cost_per_km:.2f}/km", spec_color))
    content.append((f"   Range: {vtype.max_range_km:.0f} km", spec_color))
    content.append((f"   {affordability}", afford_color))
    content.append(("", Colors.TEXT_PRIMARY))
```

### Button Improvements

```python
# More descriptive button text
btn = Button(btn_x, btn_y, btn_width, 38,
            f"Purchase {vtype.name} - ${vtype.purchase_price:,}",
            lambda vt=vtype_name: self.purchase_vehicle(vt))
btn.enabled = can_afford
```

## 📚 Educational Value

### For Students

**Understanding Vehicle Economics:**
- See all costs upfront
- Compare capacity vs cost
- Understand operating expenses
- Learn range constraints

**Strategic Decisions:**
```
Small Van:
+ Cheap ($15K)
+ Low operating cost ($0.50/km)
- Small capacity (10m³)
- Shorter range (350km)
→ Good for starting out

Medium Truck:
+ Balanced capacity (25m³)
+ Good range (450km)
~ Medium cost ($35K)
~ Medium operating ($0.80/km)
→ Best mid-game choice

Large Truck:
+ Huge capacity (50m³)
+ Best range (500km)
- Expensive ($65K)
- High operating cost ($1.20/km)
→ For high-volume operations
```
