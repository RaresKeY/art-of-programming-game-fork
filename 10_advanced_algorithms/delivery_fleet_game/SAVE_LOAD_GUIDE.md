- ✅ Before closing the game

### Multiple Playthroughs

### Automatic Save
- Game does NOT autosave
- You must click "💾 Save" manually
- Remember to save before quitting!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Save Button (`on_save`)
```python
def on_save(self):
    """Save game."""
    self.engine.save_game()
    self.show_warning("Game saved!", Colors.TEXT_ACCENT)
```

### Load Button (`on_load`)
```python
def on_load(self):
    """Load saved game."""
    try:
        self.engine.load_game()
        # Reset UI state
        self.planned_routes = []
        self.planned_metrics = None
        self.package_status = {}

        # Clear planned metrics
        self.planned_cost_stat.set_value("$0", Colors.TEXT_SECONDARY)
        self.planned_revenue_stat.set_value("$0", Colors.TEXT_SECONDARY)
        self.planned_profit_stat.set_value("$0", Colors.TEXT_SECONDARY)

        self.buttons['clear'].enabled = False
        self.buttons['execute'].enabled = False
        self.buttons['next_day'].enabled = False

        # Update display
        self.update_stats()
        self.show_warning("Game loaded successfully!", Colors.PROFIT_POSITIVE)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        self.show_warning("No saved game found!", Colors.PROFIT_NEGATIVE)

- No "undo" after loading

### UI Reset
- Load clears any in-progress planning
- Route planning must be redone
- Packages for current day remain if day started

### Best Practices
1. **Save often** - Don't lose progress
2. **Load carefully** - Replaces current state
3. **Check day/balance** - Verify correct save loaded
