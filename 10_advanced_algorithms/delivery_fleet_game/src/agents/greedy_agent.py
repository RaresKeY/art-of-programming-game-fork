"""
Greedy routing agent implementation.

This agent uses greedy heuristics for fast route planning:
- First-Fit Decreasing bin packing for package-to-vehicle assignment
- Nearest Neighbor for route optimization

Time Complexity: O(n²) where n is number of packages
Space Complexity: O(n)

Trade-offs:
+ Very fast execution
+ Simple to understand
+ Reasonable solutions for most cases
- May not find optimal solution
- No backtracking or look-ahead
