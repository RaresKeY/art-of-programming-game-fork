"""
Backtracking routing agent implementation.

This agent uses exhaustive search with pruning to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.
It explores the solution space systematically, backtracking when constraints are violated.

Time Complexity: O(m^n) where m=vehicles, n=packages (with pruning)
Space Complexity: O(n) for recursion stack

Trade-offs:
+ Can find optimal solutions
+ Explores solution space systematically
+ Good for educational purposes
- Exponential time complexity
- Only practical for small problem sizes (~15-20 packages)
- Slow compared to greedy approaches
