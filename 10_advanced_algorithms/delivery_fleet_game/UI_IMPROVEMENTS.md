# 🎨 UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

## Issues Fixed

---

## ✅ 1. Increased Font Sizes (Even Bigger!)

### Changes Made
**Updated `src/ui/constants.py`:**
```python
# Before → After
TITLE = 28 → 32        (+14%)
HEADING = 20 → 22      (+10%)
SUBHEADING = 16 → 18   (+12%)
BODY = 16 → 18         (+12%)
SMALL = 14 → 16        (+14%)  # Tooltips & Legend
TINY = 10 → 12         (+20%)
```

### Impact
- ✅ **Hover tooltips** now much more readable
- ✅ **Map legend** text larger and clearer
- ✅ **All UI text** more visible for classroom projection
- ✅ **Better accessibility** for all users

---

## ✅ 2. Fixed Pixelated Top-Right Status

### Problem
- "Day 1" and "$100,000" looked pixelated and blurry
- Used default pygame font (bitmap-based)
- Unprofessional appearance

### Solution
**Completely redesigned with:**

1. **Better Font Rendering**
   - Switched from `pygame.font.Font(None, ...)` (pixelated)
   - To `pygame.font.SysFont('arial', ..., bold=True)` (smooth anti-aliasing)

2. **Added Background Panel**
   ```python
   # Draw panel behind status
   status_panel = pygame.Rect(...)
   pygame.draw.rect(screen, Colors.PANEL_BG, status_panel, border_radius=8)
   pygame.draw.rect(screen, Colors.BORDER_LIGHT, status_panel, 2, border_radius=8)
   ```

3. **Improved Layout**
   - Labels: "Day" and "Balance" (small, gray)
   - Values: "1" and "$100,000" (large, bold, colored)
   - Clean two-column layout

### Result
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Day            Balance        │
│  1            $100,000        │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```
- ✅ Smooth, crisp text
- ✅ Professional panel background
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Color-coded balance (green=positive, red=negative)

## ✅ 3. Fixed Day Summary Button Overlap

### Problem
- Buttons overlapping last rows of text
- Text unreadable behind buttons
- Poor spacing

### Solution
1. **Added Extra Spacing**
   ```python
   content.extend([
       ("", Colors.TEXT_PRIMARY),  # Extra spacing
       ("", Colors.TEXT_PRIMARY),  # Extra spacing
   ])
   ```

2. **Moved Buttons Lower**
   ```python
   modal_btn_y = self.day_summary_modal.y + 440  # Was 420
   ```

3. **Better Positioning**
   - Buttons now 20 pixels lower
   - Clear separation from text
   - No overlap at all

### Result
```
📊 CAPACITY USAGE: 85%
